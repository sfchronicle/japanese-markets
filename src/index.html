        <p><b>1.</b> In Hokkaido, Japan, fishermen catch sea urchin (uni). Local company Hamanaka Ogawa buys the sea urchin from the fishermen, cracks open the shells, scoops out the meat and places it in seawater to prevent spoiling.</p>

        <p><b>3.</b> The next morning at around 5 a.m., Chuo Gyorui auctions the sea urchin, selling it for a rate of 1,000 to 5,000 Japanese yen ($9 to $46) for 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces). In general, the sea urchin is sold two days after it is killed.</p>
